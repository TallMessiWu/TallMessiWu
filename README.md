## Hi there 👋

I'm a data scientist who loves to code, play soccer ⚽, guitar 🎸 and piano 🎹. I also enjoy playing chess ♟️ and DOTA 2 🎮.

I graduated from UC San Diego with a major in Data Science and a minor in Economics. During my college years, I served as the Development Director of UCSD CSSA for two years.

I'm fluent in both English and Chinese, and I'm most proficient in Python 🐍. I'm highly skilled in using packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Flask, and Pytorch. I'm also familiar with Java, SQL, MongoDB, Redis, Vue, HTML, CSS, and WeChat Mini Program.
